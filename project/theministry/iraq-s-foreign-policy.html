(Iraq is a country of multiple nationalities, religions and sects, which is part of the Islamic world, and a founder and active member of the Arab League and is committed to its Charter).</p><p style="margin: 0px; text-align: justify;"> Article VIII of the Constitution determines the constants of foreign policy application and its ethics through Iraq's commitment to non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries and build peaceful and constructive dialogue with the international community parties and its parties of countries and international organizations. (Iraq abides by principles of good neighborliness, is committed to non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, seeks to resolve disputes by peaceful means, establishes relations on the basis of common interests and reciprocity, and respects its international obligations).</p><p style="margin: 0px; text-align: justify;"> Article IX of the Constitution, paragraph (H), asserts the peaceful orientation of foreign policy of the new Iraq by respecting Iraq's international obligations to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, use, production, development or possession of technology associated with them. (The Iraqi government respects for and implements Iraq's international obligations on preventing the spread and development, production and use of nuclear and chemical, and biological weapons and prevent its development, manufacture, production, use of equipment and materials, technology and communication systems).</p><p style="margin: 0px; text-align: justify;"> The Constitution has not ignored humanitarian aspects related to granting asylum, taking into consideration moral and legal aspects associated with this subject both internally and externally as part of the fundamentals of foreign policy and through Article XXI; first, second and third. (First: forbid turning Iraqi citizen to foreign authorities. Second: asylum to Iraq to be regulated by law, the political refugee cannot be turned to a foreign authority, or forcibly returned to the country which he fled. Third: the right of political asylum cannot be granted to international crimes or a terrorist suspect, or inflicted harm to Iraq).</p><p style="margin: 0px; text-align: justify;"> In completion to the constitutional vision to determine foreign policy, article 107 defines:&nbsp; first: determining foreign policy and diplomatic representation is within the competence of the federal authorities. (Federal authorities enjoy exclusive powers of the following: First: determining foreign policy and diplomatic representation and negotiation of international treaties and conventions and loans policies and signing them and determining sovereign economic and trade foreign policy). </p><p style="margin: 0px; text-align: justify;"> Second: description of the Iraqi foreign policy path in its general framework:</p><p style="margin: 0px; text-align: justify;"> It is well known that the birth of the new Iraq took place in exceptional international environment and within ​​exceptional area that witnessed the collapse of the former regime and the U.S. military presence in Iraq and the region and its repercussions on the regional and international equations in multiple political, securities, economic and social patterns. Foreign policy had to start to achieve its goals in the midst of these difficulties, and here we would like to include these main objectives in accordance to their practical order associated with conditions of that stage as follows:</p><p style="margin: 0px; text-align: justify;"> Iraq followed new foreign policy that achieve a radical change of the policy pursued by the former regime, which put Iraq in more than one international dilemma through its closed and hostile policies, through openness to the world in order to ensure the return of Iraq to its normal position and prestigious situation in the international community. Foreign policy adopted two simultaneous ways to achieve this goal since 2003 and up to now. These two ways were first crystallized by; first to complete implementation of Iraq's international obligations that could get Iraq out of Chapter VII of the UN Charter, the second is to expand Iraq's diplomatic openness around the world as confirmation of its new peaceful orientations and to achieve its political and economic interests. In this context, Iraq sought and still to resolve all outstanding issues with Kuwait, as well as resolving the outstanding issues with neighboring countries in general, with emphasis on the establishment of balanced diplomatic relations with the international community, particularly, with the United States after it completed its military withdrawal at the end of 2011 as part of the U.S. troop withdrawal agreement which represents one of the main achievements of the Iraqi foreign policy compared to similar international experiences in the same context. </p><p style="margin: 0px; text-align: justify;"> The march of the foreign policy of the Republic of Iraq takes place as part of a timeline witnessing fundamental transformations in the region and the world. These transformations as a whole represent an additional challenge to Iraq's foreign policy commitments and its goals. One of the important transformations is the wave of Arab uprisings that beset the region, Iraq was keen and through quiet and effective diplomacy to stand in similar distance from all parties of the change and within the moral and legal path of the foreign policy approach, calling for the achievement of popular demands through dialogue and political and economic reform in the uprising countries on one hand and to urge the Arab governments to take into account applying the principles of human rights in dealing with popular movements in those countries, for example, Iraq's position towards Syria through inviting its government to hold dialogue with the opposition under the auspices of the Arab League, as well as Iraq's position on the crisis in Bahrain, which demands the Bahraini government not to deal violently with demonstrators.</p><p style="margin: 0px; text-align: justify;"> One of the important achievements of the Iraqi foreign policy at this stage in the general framework, we notice Iraq's shift from the stage of reaction that accompanied the change atmosphere in 2003 to the action phase as a prelude to play a wider role in shaping political equations in the region in general, this policy within its current tracks and thanks to the development in the political process and the security situation in Iraq, the foreign policy will be able to constitute a key factor in achieving economic prosperity though active contribution of bringing foreign investment as part of Iraq's reconstruction that its beginnings are emerging at this stage that can establish economic take-off which makes Iraq's presence in the international economy effective and essential given the attributes of oil resources that makes it eligible for that role, and that too is another aspect of the Iraqi diplomatic victory with confirmation on the surrounding regional and international difficulties.</p><p style="margin: 0px; text-align: justify;"> </p><p style="margin: 0px; text-align: justify;"> </p><p style="margin: 0px; text-align: justify;"> <span style="font-weight: bold;">The new Iraq:</span></p><p style="margin: 0px; text-align: justify;"> ·&nbsp; The new Iraq inherited a heavy legacy of hostility and distrust as a result of the irresponsible policies of the former regime towards the neighboring and far countries which led to a decline in the country's position in the international community.</p><p style="margin: 0px; text-align: justify;"> ·&nbsp; The Foreign Ministry in the new Iraq faced these challenges and still, to address that legacy in a bid to retrieve Iraq's position that befits rich civilization heritage and its people and its riches. </p><p style="margin: 0px; text-align: justify;"> ·&nbsp; As representatives of the new Iraq, we have actively and successfully worked on removing the isolation condition to achieve the goals of our foreign policy in a responsible vision in accordance with the following:</p><p style="margin: 0px; text-align: justify;"> 1-&nbsp; To protect Iraq's security and promote stability and preserve the unity and harmony of society.</p><p style="margin: 0px; text-align: justify;"> 2-&nbsp; To move forward in the expansion of bilateral diplomatic relations area with the world countries and bring the international community to contribute in the reconstruction of Iraq and its infrastructure and development.</p><p style="margin: 0px; text-align: justify;"> 3-&nbsp; Contribute to building the economy in a thoughtful way that ensures raising the standard of the Iraqi people's living.</p><p style="margin: 0px; text-align: justify;"> 4-&nbsp; Promoting the activity of the Iraqi diplomatic missions and enhances Iraq's interests in political, economic, social and cultural spheres.</p><p style="margin: 0px; text-align: justify;"> 5-&nbsp; Continue the support of Iraq's role in multilateral bodies towards a more active work, and strive to expand Iraq's international participation by joining more of those bodies, particularly the economic ones.</p><p style="margin: 0px; text-align: justify;"> 6-&nbsp; Continue upgrading the work of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the level of performance, guided by the constitutional basis and legal controls designed to achieve Iraq's vision in a way that matches its prestigious stature as a civilization and people.</p><p style="margin: 0px; text-align: justify;"> 7-&nbsp; Strengthen the foundations of democracy within the framework of sovereignty, unity and equality among citizens.</p><p style="margin: 0px; text-align: justify;"> ·&nbsp; Iraq confirms its peaceful foreign policy aiming at normalization of diplomatic relations with the international community on the basis of cooperation and respect for mutual interests and sponsoring them in accordance with the international law and stand at the same distance from all international parties in an equitable manner.</p><p style="margin: 0px; text-align: justify;"> </p><p style="margin: 0px; text-align: justify;"> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Iraq's security:</span></p><p style="margin: 0px; text-align: justify;"> Among the most important priorities of the Government of the Republic of Iraq is enhancing cooperation with the neighboring countries in particular and the international community in general in the security areas to protect Iraq's and the region's security from internal and external threats, especially terrorist ones, and to enhance the security successes achieved after Iraq regained national sovereignty, which was culminated in the withdrawal of all coalition forces by the U.S. troops withdraw agreement from Iraq signed between the Republic of Iraq and the U.S.</p><p></p><br>
