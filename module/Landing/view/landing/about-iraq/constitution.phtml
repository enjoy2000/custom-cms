<?php echo $this->translate('We, the people of Mesopotamia, the&nbsp;homeland of the apostles and prophets, resting&nbsp;place of the virtuous imams, cradle of civilization,&nbsp;crafters of writing, and home of numeration. Upon&nbsp;our land the first law made by man was passed,&nbsp;and the oldest pact of just governance was&nbsp;inscribed, and upon our soil the &nbsp;saints and&nbsp;companions of the Prophet prayed, philosophers&nbsp;and scientists theorized, and writers and poets&nbsp;excelled;&nbsp;Acknowledging God’s right over us, and infulfillment of the call of our homeland and citizens,&nbsp;and in a response to the call of our religious and&nbsp;national leaderships and the determination of our&nbsp;great authorities and of our leaders and politicians,&nbsp;and in the &nbsp;midst of international support from our&nbsp;friends and those who love us, marched for the first&nbsp;time in our history towards the ballot boxes by themillions, men and women, young and old, on the&nbsp;thirtieth of January 2005, invoking the pains of&nbsp;sectarian oppression inflicted by the autocratic&nbsp;clique and inspired by the tragedies of Iraq’s&nbsp;martyrs, Shiite and Sunni, Arabs and Kurds &nbsp; &nbsp;and&nbsp;Turkmen and from all other components of the&nbsp;people, and recollecting the darkness of the&nbsp;ravage of the holy cities and the South in the&nbsp;Sha’abaniyya uprising and burnt by the flames of&nbsp;grief of the mass graves, the marshes, Al-Dujail&nbsp;
and others and articulating the sufferings of racial&nbsp;oppression in the massacres of Halabcha, Barzan,&nbsp;Anfal and the Fayli Kurds and inspired by the&nbsp;ordeals of the Turkmen in Bashir and the sufferings&nbsp;of the people of the western region, as is the case&nbsp;in the remaining areas of Iraq where the people&nbsp;
suffered from the liquidation of their leaders,&nbsp;symbols, and Sheiks and from the displacement of&nbsp;their skilled individuals and from drying out of its&nbsp;cultural and intellectual wells, so we sought hand&nbsp;in hand and shoulder to shoulder to create our new&nbsp;Iraq, the Iraq of the future, free from sectarianism,
racism, complex of regional attachment,&nbsp;discrimination, and exclusion.&nbsp;Accusations of being infidels, and terrorismdid not stop us from marching forward to build a&nbsp;nation of law. Sectarianism and racism have not&nbsp;stopped us from marching together to strengthen&nbsp;our national unity, following the path of peaceful&nbsp;transfer of power, adopting the course of just&nbsp;distribution of resources, and providing equal&nbsp;opportunity for all.&nbsp;We, the people of Iraq, who have just risenfrom our stumble, and who are looking with&nbsp;
confidence to the future through a republican,&nbsp;federal, democratic, pluralistic system, have&nbsp;resolved with the determination of our men,&nbsp;women, elderly, and youth to respect the rule of&nbsp;law, to establish justice and equality, to cast aside&nbsp;the politics of aggression, to pay attention to
women and their rights, the elderly and their&nbsp;concerns, and children and their affairs, to spread&nbsp;the culture of diversity, and to defuse terrorism.&nbsp;We, the people of Iraq, of all componentsand across the spectrum, have taken upon
ourselves to decide freely and by choice to unite&nbsp;our future, to take lessons from yesterday for&nbsp;tomorrow, and to enact this permanent&nbsp;Constitution, through the values and ideals of theheavenly messages and the findings of science&nbsp;and man’s civilization. The adherence to this&nbsp;Constitution preserves for Iraq its free union of&nbsp;people, of land, and of sovereignty.') ?>'
