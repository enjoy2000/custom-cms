The institution, its missions and its activities, were abused to spy and intimidate in deliberate breach of internationally-accepted diplomatic practice. The professionalism of Ministry staff was undermined and any initiative was suffocated by an oppressive and corrupt working culture. <br><br>Today, Ministry of Foreign Affairs personnel are undertaking diplomatic training overseas through professional development programs provided by host countries. These programs include language and information technology skills, diplomatic training in all fields and exposure to internationally accepted diplomatic practices. Since August last year, 251 members of the Ministry's staff have been selected to go to twenty countries to receive diplomatic training. The countries are Pakistan, Poland, the Czech Republic, India, Jordan, South Korea, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Germany, Romania, Turkey, China, Spain, the Netherlands, Egypt, Malaysia, The Sudan, Austria and Switzerland. Some 60 members of staff have already started their training in Pakistan, Poland, the Czech Republic, India, Jordan, Korea and the United Kingdom, while 35 other staff have returned from Pakistan, the Czech Republic, Jordan and India. <br><br>The new Ministry of Foreign Affairs is further committed to enhance its foreign policy capabilities through reforming and modernising its organisation, personnel and activities according to the following principles: </div><ul><li>The development and implementation of transparent selection and recruitment processes in conjunction with a ministry-wide de-Ba'athification program; <br><br></li><li>New standard recruitment procedures based on merit, equal opportunities and a just and fair criteria offering various entry levels and opportunity to all sectors of Iraqi society, in particular to women; <br><br></li><li>Recruitment campaigns conducted through public announcement; <br><br></li><li>Employee vetting, training assessments and personnel evaluation undertaken via open and standard procedures. <br><br></li><li>Preparations are also ongoing to re-open and reform the Foreign Service Institute in order to resume normal diplomatic training activity. Since early 2003, the building's restoration has been completed and serves as temporary accommodation for the Ministry. <br><br></li><li>All Ministry of Foreign Affairs personnel must possess an understanding of human rights issues, democratic principles and the prerequisite of political impartiality in civil service; <br><br></li><li>All Ministry of Foreign Affairs personnel must possess an understanding of human rights issues, democratic principles and the prerequisite of political impartiality in civil service; <br><br></li><li>Employee commitment to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' new work ethic of integrity, professional respect and a commitment to serve in the best interests of the Iraqi people. <br><br></li><li>The Ministry is committed to working practices that encourage initiative, professional skill development, communication and objectivity in provision of foreign policy advice. <br><br></li><li>All new initiatives and restructuring changes are communicated throughout the Ministry. </li></ul></div><p></p><br>
