We strongly condemn the devastating bombing of the United Nations Headquarters in Baghdad in August 2003 and pay tribute to the late Sergio Vieira de Mello who was an effective and committed role model for the United Nation's work in Iraq.<br<br> The United Nations has issued three Security Council Resolutions on the future of Iraq since May 2003 (UNSCRs1483, 1500 and 1511), which provide a wide mandate for UN involvement in political, economic and administrative fields. The UN has an effective role to play in Iraq in humanitarian affairs, capacity building and democratic reform among other areas and we welcome the two teams which recently arrived in Iraq to assist in the political and electoral processes. The United Nations also currently operates out of Amman and Cyprus with Mr. Ross Mountain supervising these efforts as Acting Special Representative.</br><br></p><p style="margin: 0px;"><br></p><li>In December 2003, the Minister of Foreign Affairs presented the United Nations General Assembly with the timetable for the restoration of sovereignty to Iraq in accordance with the November 15th Agreement on Political Process, signed between the Iraqi Governing Council and the Coalition Provisional Authority in Baghdad.<br><br></li><li>In January 2004, Iraq participated in tripartite meetings at the United Nations between the Iraqi Governing Council, Coalition Provisional Authority and the United Nations Secretariat to discuss the way forward for the UN's role in Iraq in political, electoral and constitutional fields.<br><br></li><li>In February 2004, the UN's Special Advisor to Iraq, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, and a UN electoral team conducted a fact-finding mission on the feasibility of elections in Iraq prior to June 30th 2004.<br><br></li><li>In March 2004 and in response to a request from the Iraqi Governing Council, a UN team of electoral experts arrived in Iraq to help with preparations for direct elections to be held by the end of January 2005. The UN Secretary General also dispatched a team of UN officials, led by Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, to assist with the transfer of sovereignty on June 30th 2004.<br><br><br></li></div><p></p><br>
