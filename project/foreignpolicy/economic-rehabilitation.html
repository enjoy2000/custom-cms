Foreign Service Law No. 45 of 2008 was issued to be a mainstay in determining the mechanisms of work within the organizational structure of the Iraqi diplomacy institution to grant it more disciplined flexibility, and by virtue of that low , a system of Foreign Service no. (1) of 2010 was also issued to clarify the practical purposes of the Foreign Service Law . To complete the ministry's pursuit for making the work more sophisticated and flexible, the ministry issued a booklet on its instructions to address the practical difficulties that appear during all types of the ministerial workflow. </p><p><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The Most Important Conventions and Treaties</span><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span><br>&nbsp;The Multilateral conventions<br>&nbsp;Agreements with the Islamic Conference&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;Agreements with the Arab countries<br>&nbsp;Agreements with the Asian countries<br>&nbsp;Agreements with the African countries<br>&nbsp;Agreements with the European countries<br>&nbsp;Agreements with the United States of America<br>&nbsp;Agreements with the Latin American countries</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><div style="text-align: justify;"><br><br></div><p></p><br>
