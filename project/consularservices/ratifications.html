In case there was no Iraqi mission in the concerned country, the ratification of a document is ratified by that country's mission in Iraq, and then approved by the Department of Ratifications in the Iraqi Consular Department.<br>8. In case there was no Iraqi mission in the country in which the document was issued, and there was no mission of that country in Iraq, then the ratification of a document or certificate is done in another country where there are missions to that country and an Iraqi mission in order to be approved by the two missions and then ratified by Department of Ratifications in the Consular Department.<br>9.

Commercial lists' and certificates of origin's contents must be ratified, because the ratification of the signatures is not enough.
