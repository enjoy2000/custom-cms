"We, the people of Mesopotamia, the&nbsp;homeland of the apostles and prophets, "
"resting&nbsp;place of the virtuous imams, cradle of civilization,&nbsp;crafters "
"of writing, and home of numeration. Upon&nbsp;our land the first law made by "
"man was passed,&nbsp;and the oldest pact of just governance was&nbsp;inscribed, "
"and upon our soil the &nbsp;saints and&nbsp;companions of the Prophet prayed, "
"philosophers&nbsp;and scientists theorized, and writers and poets&nbsp;excelled;"
"&nbsp;Acknowledging God’s right over us, and infulfillment of the call of our "

"and&nbsp;national leaderships and the determination of our&nbsp;great "
"authorities and of our leaders and politicians,&nbsp;and in the &nbsp;midst of "
"international support from our&nbsp;friends and those who love us, marched for "
"the first&nbsp;time in our history towards the ballot boxes by themillions, men "
"and women, young and old, on the&nbsp;thirtieth of January 2005, invoking the "
"pains of&nbsp;sectarian oppression inflicted by the autocratic&nbsp;clique and "
"inspired by the tragedies of Iraq’s&nbsp;martyrs, Shiite and Sunni, Arabs and "
"Kurds &nbsp; &nbsp;and&nbsp;Turkmen and from all other components of the&nbsp;"

"from sectarianism,\n"
"racism, complex of regional attachment,&nbsp;discrimination, and exclusion."
"&nbsp;Accusations of being infidels, and terrorismdid not stop us from marching "

"stopped us from marching together to strengthen&nbsp;our national unity, "
"following the path of peaceful&nbsp;transfer of power, adopting the course of "
"just&nbsp;distribution of resources, and providing equal&nbsp;opportunity for "
"all.&nbsp;We, the people of Iraq, who have just risenfrom our stumble, and who "

"women and their rights, the elderly and their&nbsp;concerns, and children and "
"their affairs, to spread&nbsp;the culture of diversity, and to defuse terrorism."
"&nbsp;We, the people of Iraq, of all componentsand across the spectrum, have "
